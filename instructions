The purpose of this Java application is to run a JMeter test and return a FAIL, PASS or WARNING  (0, 1 or 2) based on the command line paramters:

test=XXXXXX                   // name of the test without an extension -required
completions=XXXXX			  // expected number of thread completions
avg=XXXXX					  // Average server delay 
variance=XX					  // max tolerance expressed as a percentage (default is 20%)
rate=XX 					  // max error rate as a percentage

If completions is specified return a zero (failed) if actual completions is less than variance% of expected

if avg is greater than the average server delay + variance%  return a 2 (WARNING)

if error rate is > rate return zero (failed)

if there are any 500 series errors or any 400 series (except for 401) return zero (fail)

if there are any failures return zero (fail)

otherwise return 1  (pass)


please add 3 more command line parameters:
1. maxthreads
2. ramptime
3. duration

if these are specified they will temporarily override the values in the JMX file


input sample:
java DriverClass test=BuyPets completions=1100 avg=800 varience=25 rate=2

new input sample:
java DriverClass test=BuyPets completions=1100 avg=800 varience=20 rate=2 maxthreads=12 ramptime=1 duration=70
